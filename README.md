# Nested Comments Using React

A few things currently in progress

1. React Context API to eliminate prop drilling
2. Testing with Cypress/React Testing Library
3. Move comment box to bottom of screeen on mobile
4. Recursive comment count -- current count only counts the top level comments
5. Drop down to toggle replies
6. Use one comment box for both replies and top level comments. Having a nested reply box is not cool! (also show who the curren reply is being addressed to)
7. A comprehensive README (with GIF)
